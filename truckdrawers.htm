    <h2>More About the Truck Bed Drawers</h2>

      <p>On a trip. The drawer height was actually designed to fit the yellow northface bag shown in the back of the left drawer. This conveniently fit the small cooler shown in the right drawer as well. </p>

<p>The drawers were originally built to double as a sleeping platform once a topper was added to the truck. However, their weight, around 350 lbs, caused the truck to squat. Since upgrading the suspension wasn’t preferred, the drawers were removed and the wood was recycled for other projects around the apartment.</p>

<p>If I were to build another set, I’d focus on minimizing weight. I’d likely reduce the height and design the layout around specific gear. For example, limiting contents to essentials like cooking equipment and recovery tools (e.g., 2-burner stove, propane, utensils, paper towels, first aid, tow straps, come-along, and select tools) would allow for much shorter drawers while still organizing gear that stays in the truck year-round.</p>
