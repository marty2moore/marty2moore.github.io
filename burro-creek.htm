    <h3>Day 1</h3>
    <img src="jpg/slot-canyon.jpg" alt="Slot Canyon" />
    <p>Steven and I departed Phoenix and made our way out into the middle of nowhere, Arizona. We had lofty goals and were excited to spend the week working on the wall developing new climbing routes. Steven was going to be living out of his van for the week, and I was going to be in a large tent. After setting up on BLM land just off the highway, we still had a bit of daylight so we set out to what Steven called the Slot Canyon to fix some lines we could easily ascend later in the week. Our goal was to set up the infrastructure to quickly get to higher routes in the coming days. Steven put a trad line up to get to the base of the good rock and fixed a line we could use to easily access rock up above. I followed the unnamed route and gathered his equipment. We rappelled off the fixed line to get down just as the sun was setting. This was a great introduction to ground up ascents and a reminder of how delicate climbing and awareness are such important factors to maintaining safety. Unfortunately, the fixed line we set up was not much use to us as the rock above needed to be accessed by hiking around the top and rappelling in.</p>

    <h3>Day 2</h3>
    <img src="jpg/PaulsWall.jpg" alt="Pauls Wall" />
    <p>On the first full day of the trip, Sarah was with us so we ended up spending most of the day climbing. Steven showed us around Burro Wall and we eventually worked our way around to Paul’s Wall for my first ground up FA. On the left side of Paul’s Wall, 2 wider cracks captured our attention. Looking up at the climbs, we could see quite a few larger blocks in both cracks. I picked a line that used both cracks and avoided these larger, microwave sized, rocks. After leading and building an anchor on the crumbling rock, Steven followed my line on a top down, top rope belay and cleaned the rocks on his way. Now that no one or no rope was below, we were free to push the loose rock off the climb. This allows any repeat ascents to be much safer. When Steven reached my trad anchor, he installed 2 bolts for a permanent anchor and we lowered to the ground, cleaning more on the way.</p>

    <h3>Day 3</h3>
    <img src="jpg/AuroraWall.jpg" alt="Aurora Wall" />
    <p>On the second full day, when we were climbing at the Burrow Wall, Steven and I noticed some prominent features a little ways to the right on a much taller section of the cliffline. Since the fixed line we placed on the first day in the Slot Canyon did not give us much of a leg up for the next effort, we decided to pursue this taller wall on day 3. Steven already had some access anchors at the top we could lower in from. Steven was stoked on a prominent arete and I was a little clueless as to what to look for in a line so I decided to find a line just to the right of his. As we lowered in, the stoke started to build as I saw a beautiful line up into a shallow dihedral and eventually over a bulge to what would eventually become the location for my anchors. This upper section was beautiful enough for me to want to make the lower section work.</p>

    <h3>Day 4</h3>
    <img src="jpg/BloodMoon.jpg" alt="Blood Moon" />
    <p>On day 4, Steven and I spent most of the day cleaning our routes and figuring out where we wanted bolts to guide climbers through the lines. A red aurora presented itself to us that night. </p>

    <h3>Day 5</h3>
    <img src="jpg/Blood.jpg" alt="Blood" />
    <p>We spent the 5th day cleaning our routes again. We were joined by David Sampson, who has over 800 FA’s all across the country. As we cleaned, he checked out a face on the left side of the arete Steven was developing. As exhaustion was fully setting in, I was hammering a stubborn rock about a foot above and 2 feet to the right of my right ankle. As I hammered it, I could see movement, but it needed a heavy hand in order to come off the wall. I slammed the hammer into it and a baseball sized chunk cracked off and flew straight into the outside of my right ankle. The pain wasn’t immediate, but blood started to pour out of my ankle. Luckily, Steven was above me on his route and had a roll of tape on hand. He swung over and handed off the roll. I taped up the wound thoroughly and got back to work cleaning my route. I didn’t feel the ankle too much while sitting in my harness and only really needed to use my hands and left foot for positioning. The severity of this cut had not really been noticed yet. After a few more hours, we were wrapping up on the wall and needed to hike out for the day. As I touched down to the ground, I realized that maybe I did not just cut myself with the rock. Nothing was broken, but I felt a decent amount of pain in my ankle when loading it on anything other than perfectly flat ground. I believe the blunt impact from the rock gave me a minor bone bruise. I am extremely fortunate the injury was not worse and that I was able to carefully hike out for the night. The way to camp was roughly 15 minutes of scrambling (on a healthy foot), followed by a flat hike up through a dried river wash. </p>

    <h3>Day 6</h3>
    <img src="jpg/Top of BM.jpg" alt="Top of BM" />
    <p>We started the next day slowly. My foot was extremely tender and I was in need of some rest. Steven and David put up a new route in the Slot Canyon and I read most of the day.</p>
  </section>

    <h3>Day 7</h3>
    <img src="jpg/FA.JPG" alt="BM FA" />
    <p>This was another full day of cleaning. At the very end of the day, Steven and I completed our climbs and attained the first ascents. My climb, Blood Moon, was 5.10 and Steven’s, Vermin Excursion, was a harder 11+ or 12a. It felt amazing to complete these routes after days of clearing off choss. </p>

    <h3>Day 8</h3>
    <img src="jpg/VI and BM.jpg" alt="VI and BM" />
    <p>Half day of climbing cut short by rain. Drove back to Phoenix for flight the next day. Shown in the image above are Steven and my completed lines. </p>
